# ElectronConfigurationVisuazlier

Implementations/bug fixes to be added:

(Debug) - Input value 118 returns ArrayOutOfBoundsException when fetching data from csv file

(Implement) - Process abbreviated electron configuration strings where applicable

(Implement) - Look into using threads to handle code in the draw() function (reduce delay times as more electrons are drawn)

(Implement) - Generalize code to display elements 61-118 once the last two implementations are completed
